    I implemented the model classes for the application. I created a base abstract class
    named Model that defines methods that belong to all of the model classes. Model is
    extended by PitModel and MancalaModel which operate on data pertaining to
    the pit and mancala respectively.

    I also implemented the mancala game logic in the MancalagGame class. The class was complicated
    to write, but I did it somehow. I used JUnit to write a few unit tests to ensure program correctness.
    So far, the all tests are passing, so we should be good on the game logic side of the application.
