Which materials/key concepts from this course did you apply on the project?
This project was heavily dependent on the concepts learned in CS 151. The project followed the Observer pattern which contains View, Controller, and Model classes. In our project Board.java, pit.java, and mancala.java were View class. As for Controller, MancalaGame.java was the only controller which decides the fate of the game. This class had the entire game logic oncorporated in its controller. The number of stones 3 or 4 was picked here, updating the player, getting the number of players were also done here. Model classes were Model.java, PitModel.java, and MancalaModel.java which resembled the model that the pits should follow. Pits were kept track via 2 arraylists. MancalaModel resembles the basic model either side mancala should have.
Inheritance(Is-a), Implementation(Has-a) relationship were the topics followed along GUI swing library implementation. PitModel.java and MancalaModel.java portrays an is-a relationship with Model.java. Mancala.java was also extended(is-a) of pit.java. Pit was extended from overarching predefined Jcomponent from Java std library. Board.java portrays the two different views a player can choose to play the game on, this class is extended off Jpanel and all its predefined methods. Board.java also enables mouse actions in the game. settingBoardtheme in board.java and component resized methods are the GUI part of MVC pattern Mancala game Seal Team Six created the pits and the board a color is also part of the Grahical User Interface part of project. This is done in the BoardTheme.java, which is the interface for the project. 
Which topics did you have to learn through self-study in order to complete the project?
Usually in assignments and class lecture notes, the simple 3 class, 1 model, 1 view, 1 controller type of program have been familiarized with. Including 9 java classes in the same package and making it work was a new concept and was done through self study. At the same time it was not completely own our own as we had an idea of the inheritcance, implementation, and association relationship among class from lecture notes. commitChange() invoked with actionListeners was a new type of method that needed to be implemented in our project which was taught through self study. setUIFont() to define the particular font type was learned from swing library through individual research.
